## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Adidas Sales Dataset to analyze and help answer these questions:

1. Does day of week has an effect on total sales?
2. At which price per unit do we generate the most operating margin?
3. Which sales method\product\state generated the most operating margin?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is the Analysis notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
